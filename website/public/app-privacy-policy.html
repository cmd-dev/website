    <p><strong><strong> From their website:</strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong><strong>&ldquo;</strong></strong></p>
    <p>We take this responsibility seriously, and are dedicated to making every effort to protect customer data,
        including continually improving security processes and controls, as well as upholding transparency with regards
        to data usage. In addition, we are committed to delivering the highest levels of standards conformance and
        regulatory compliance as part of our ongoing mission to address the most demanding security and privacy
        requirements of our customers.</p>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>MongoDB Atlas offers enterprise-level security features so you can set up rigorous controls for who can access,
        manipulate, and delete data in your databases.</p>
    <h4><em><em>Network isolation and access</em></em></h4>
    <p>MongoDB Atlas users&rsquo; data and underlying systems are fully isolated from other users. Database resources
        are associated with a user group, which is contained in its own Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Access must be
        granted by IP whitelisting or VPC Peering.</p>
    <h4><em><em>Encryption in flight and at rest</em></em></h4>
    <p>For MongoDB Atlas databases, all network traffic is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). Encryption
        for data at rest is automated using encrypted storage volumes. Users can bring their own encryption keys for an
        additional level of control.</p>
    <h4><em><em>Granular database auditing</em></em></h4>
    <p>Granular database auditing in MongoDB Atlas allows administrators to answer detailed questions about systems
        activity by tracking all commands against the database.</p>
    <p>MongoDB Atlas undergoes independent verification of platform security, privacy, and compliance controls. Our
        strong and growing focus on standards conformance and compliance will help you meet your regulatory and policy
        objectives.</p>
    <p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of your data stored in our products and services.</p>
    <p>Your data stored in our cloud products can be accessed by authorized MongoDB personnel only to ensure reliability
        of service. Access is restricted tightly and monitored using both logical controls and management processes.</p>
    <h4><em><em>Logical Controls</em></em></h4>
    <p>Role-based access controls (RBAC) ensure only a small group of MongoDB reliability engineers can access systems.
        In addition, access requires multi-factor authentication (MFA) through a secure bastion host with actions
        logged.</p>
    <h4><em><em>Management Processes</em></em></h4>
    <p>Access is granted by senior management only during service reliability issues. Access logs, as well as
        permissions and entitlements, are regularly audited.</p>
    <p><strong><strong>&ldquo;</strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong><strong>We use Firebase Authentication to store sensitive

                <td width="376">
                    <p>How it helps: Firebase Authentication uses the data to enable end-user authentication, and
                        facilitate end-user account management. It also uses user-agent strings and IP addresses to
                        provide added security and prevent abuse during sign-up and authentication.</p>
                    <p>Retention: Firebase Authentication keeps logged IP addresses for a few weeks. It retains other
                        authentication information until the Firebase customer initiates deletion of the associated
                        user, after which data is removed from live and backup systems within 180 days.</p>

                <td width="376">
                    <p>How it helps: Firebase Crashlytics uses crash stack traces to associate crashes with a project,
                        send email alerts to project members and display them in the Firebase Console, and help Firebase
                        customers debug crashes. It uses Instance IDs to measure the number of users impacted by a crash
                        and minidump data to process NDK crashes. The minidump data is stored while the crash session is
                        being processed and then discarded. Refer to <a href="#crash-stored-info">Examples of stored
                            device information</a>&nbsp;for more detail on the types of user information gathered.</p>

                        associated identifiers (including Instance IDs) for 90 days.</p>
                    <p>Note: Firebase Crashlytics stores minidump data only temporarily in order to process NDK crashes.

    <p>Our App offers you the ability to register and login using your third-party social media account details (like

        you from your social media provider. The profile Information we receive may vary depending on the social media
        provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, profile picture as well as
        other information you choose to make public on such social media platform.</p>
    <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy noticeor that are
        otherwise made clear to you on the relevant App. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible
        for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you

        can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>

                ANYONE?</u></a>" above), in and other countries.</p>
    <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries may not necessarily have data
        protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however take all
        necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice
        and&nbsp;applicable law.</p>

    <p>The App may contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other
        websites, online services or mobile applications. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide
        to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not
        responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other
        websites, services or applications that may be linked to or from the App. You should review the policies of such
        third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.</p>

    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
        privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or
        other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for
        longer than three (3) months past the start of idle period of the user's account.</p>
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
        anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
        stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
        further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

    <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security
        of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information,
        no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
        secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will
        not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although
        we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        App is at your own risk. You should only access the App within a secure environment.</p>

        standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
